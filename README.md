# 100 Daily UI Challenges

My "attempt" at the 100 Daily UI Challenges from #DailyUI. For 100 days, I will receive one Web Design/UI Challenge from Daily UI.


*Each challenge has its own folder with its content inside. The .png file represents the challenge description provided by DailyUI, and a link to where I uploaded it.*
